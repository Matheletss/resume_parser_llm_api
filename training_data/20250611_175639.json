Answered complex queries from\nstudents and educators, offering detailed explanations.\no Created solutions and instructional materials tailored to enhance learning outcomes. Contributed to the development of\nhigh-quality resources for statistics education\nPROJECTS/RESEARCH WORK\n•\nPaddy Disease Classification\no Developed a machine learning model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately classify diseases\nin paddy crops, enhancing disease detection and agricultural management.\n• AI Interview Platform\no Created an AI-powered interview practice platform that simulates mock interviews, providing users with real-time\nfeedback and improving their interview preparation.\n•\nApplication of Autoencoders for Anonymizing Telecom Data:\no A framework that applies autoencoders to anonymize telecommunication data (IP addresses, call detail records\n(CDRs), serial numbers, and personal data, etc.) . The key contribution of this work was turning personally\nidentifiable information (PII) into anonymized data for research to allow release of valuable data to public while\nfollowing privacy and security procedures.\n•\nMulti-Objective Optimization of Tourist Carrying Capacity Using the Heuristic Approach\no This work proposed a multi-objective optimization framework applying NSGA-II to tourist carrying capacity\n(TCC) evaluation. Unlike traditional evaluation methods, this framework optimizes environment, economy, social,\nand infrastructure in a sustainable adaptive and efficient way. Destination managers could use this framework to\nhelp solve complex, multi-dimensional problems in a sustainable fashion. This work Abstract is provisionally\naccepted for book titled 'Decision Analytics for Tourism Planning and Management'\nLeadership & Volunteer Experience\n• Serving as the Vice President - Outreach for the Society for Data Science at BIT Mesra, I led and managed strategic initiatives\nto strengthen the community's engagement and outreach. I played a pivotal role in organizing and executing eastern India’s\nlargest Data Science Summits in both 2023 and 2024.\n•\nThese high-impact events attracted a diverse audience, including industry experts, academic professionals, and data\nscience enthusiasts, fostering a collaborative environment for knowledge sharing, skill development, and networking. My\nleadership involved coordinating with industry partners, securing sponsorships, and managing large-scale event logistics\nto ensure the success of these summits.\nSkills\n• General: Python, C/C++, Java, SQL, Docker, Git/GitHub\n• Web Technologies: HTML/CSS\n• Data Science & ML: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, TensorRT, R, Autoencoders, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised\nLearning, Feature Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Model Evaluation & Tuning, Data\nPreprocessing, and Ensemble Methods."
